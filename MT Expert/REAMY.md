To ensure the connection between the customerâ€™s application and the MetaTrade trading platform, it was decided to use an expert. 
One of them makes decisions based on the price of options from another trading platform (InteractiveBrokers in this case) that were transferred by the client application.
The other only processes requests for opening and closing positions received from one of the application modules via the pipe channel.
