# Trade
Some work project
It was a project that I created working with ФОП Якименко В. М. 
Most of the material consists of separate modules, an application that was made before me. 
The repository presents a library intended for arbitrage trading between two financial instruments, and modules for analysis and decision making.
Some modules used pipe server in IN_OUT mode, which is provided by Yummy. In fact, I don’t know what kind of library it is, when you set PipeServer you need to provide request delegate that will handle the interaction with the pipes. That's all what I know about Yummy.
